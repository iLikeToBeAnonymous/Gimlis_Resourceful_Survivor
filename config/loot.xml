From studying ExtremeLurker's code, I've learned:
	A container filled with loot requires 4 things:
	1)	A lootqualitytemplate
		• 	This determines the QUALITY of what's in the loot.
		•	For example, if there will be an axe in the loot, it's level will be
			determined by the lootqualitytemplate.
	2)	A lootgroup
		•	This determines the items and their quantity.
	3)	The lootcontainer
		•	This is essentially the way the lootqualitytemplate and the lootgroup get
			bundled together under an id so it can be called by the entity_class (which
			is in the entityclasses.xml file)
		•	The size property determines the inventory grid size for the container.
			1st number is columns, 2nd number is rows. MAKE SURE THE GRID IS BIG ENOUGH
			FOR ALL THE ITEMS YOU'VE PUT IN IT!
		•	Lootcontainer ID MUST be an integer!!! (not sure how to make this so it doesn't potentially conflict with other container ID's)
	4)	The entity_class (found in entityclasses.xml)
		•	This... I'm not quite as clear as to how it works. 
			The "Class" and "Parent" seem to be something special and are kind of like
			blocks, but don't appear anywhere in blocks.xml.
		•	entity_class name is how the finished thing gets spawned.
		•	LootListAlive is the ID of the lootcontainer from loot.xml.
